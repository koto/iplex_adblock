Adblock HTTP proxy server for iplex.pl movies

Iplex.pl is a movie-streaming site using some Java-based movie player. You have to watch a ton of ads
before watching a movie. And I don't like ads. 

Iplex-adblock is a HTTP proxy server that rewrites http://www.iplex.pl/player_feed/ XML documents, removing ads
from them.

Requirements:
  - python 2.x
  - Twisted ( http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ ) 
 
Usage:
  1. $ src/start_proxy.py 8080
  2. Set your HTTP proxy to 127.0.0.1:8080
  3. Point your browser http://www.iplex.pl 
  4. Enjoy!
